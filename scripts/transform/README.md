# About
This macro allows for positioning of a selection of objects.
It adds temporary bounding boxes and center marks before moving
the objects and removes them after the translation is complete.

It supports:
- Translation of a single, multiple or a group (FreeCAD group)
  of objects.
- Snapping to center and origin marks (after adding them).
- Addition of "edge-to-edge", "vertex-to-vertex" and
  "vertex-to-edge" dimensions.
